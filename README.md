#### Nice to "meet" you, I'm Nathaniel!

I'm a junior developer currently in school at [The Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/) focusing on front end development.
I can be reached pretty easily via [email](mailto:nathanielmillard@gmail.com) or on [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathaniel-m-94a259165/).

Updates to come as I work on my own branding and flesh out my personal website...
